Overview of the Face Detection and Recognition Attendance System

The Face Detection and Recognition Attendance System is a web-based application designed to automate attendance management using facial recognition technology. The system leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect, recognize, and manage user attendance seamlessly.

 Key Objectives
- Automate attendance tracking for employees, students, or other users.  
- Provide a secure and user-friendly interface for real-time face detection and recognition.  
- Enable administrators to manage users, attendance logs, and system operations efficiently.  

 System Workflow
1. User Registration:  
   Users register by providing personal details and capturing their face data via a webcam. This data is stored and used for training the recognition model.

2. Model Training:  
   A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier processes captured face images, extracts features, and trains a model to recognize registered users.

3. Real-Time Recognition:  
   During attendance marking, the system activates the webcam, detects faces in real-time using OpenCV, and identifies them using the trained model. Recognized users are marked as present with a timestamp.

4. Attendance Management:  
   The system records attendance in a structured format (CSV or database) and provides tools for admins to view, edit, or delete logs.

 Technologies Used
- Frontend: Flask templates (HTML/CSS/JS) for user interaction.  
- Backend: Python, Flask framework for server-side logic.  
- Machine Learning: OpenCV for face detection; Scikit-learn (KNN) for recognition.  
- Data Storage: Local CSV files or relational databases for user and attendance records.  

 Features
- Role-based access control for users and admins.  
- Real-time face detection with high accuracy.  
- Attendance logs with options to view, edit, and export data.  
- Secure and scalable design with modular components.  

This system reduces manual efforts, ensures accuracy, and provides a scalable solution for attendance tracking in various domains.
